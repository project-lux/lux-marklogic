Setup:

1. Deploy support.xqy to a modules database.

Usage:

1. Invoke http://[ml-host]:[port]/[modules-path/]support.xqy?filename=[absolute-path-to-support-dump-file]

2. [port] needs to align with the modules database the support.xqy was deployed within.

3. If support.xqy wasn't deployed in the module database's root, replace [modules-path/] with the path; else, the delete placeholder.

4. Replace [absolute-path-to-support-dump-file] with the absolute path to the support dump file that the ML node can reach.

If the dump includes log files, you may have to manually remove the access log entries from the support dump for one or more nodes in the cluster.
