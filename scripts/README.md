# Scripts

Scripts herein may be executed from within VS Code (once connected to a MarkLogic instance) or via Query Console.  The former is encouraged as it is easier to collaborate.

For directions on connecting VS Code to MarkLogic, please see [MarkLogic's VS Code plugin page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mlxprs.mlxprs).
