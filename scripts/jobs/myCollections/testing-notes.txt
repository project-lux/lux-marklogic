Based on the operation, swap out [verb] for:
  backup
  restore
  ...

cd /host/code/[verb]

Configure [verb]-options.txt
You will need a MarkLogic user that has the "%%mlAppName%%-my-collections-data-updater" (preferred) or admin role.

sh [verb]-my-collections-data.sh [verb]-options.txt

Validation:
  backup: If all went well, you can download the newly created zip, uncompress, and check the contents.
  restore: Between backup and restore, change a My Collection document in the database; after restore, see if the edit is gone.
